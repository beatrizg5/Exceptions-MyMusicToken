## üñ•Ô∏è About the Project

This application derives from a legacy project, where we seek to improve it by applying microservices techniques allowing the new application to perform an independent scaling of APIs, grouped according to the customer's business domains.
The project pursuit to show the result of teamwork, developed by CI&T juniors programmers as a way of showing our knowledge. Enjoy! üöÄ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
The software design pattern is defined by an adaptation of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture concepts. As this is a strictly back-end development, the view module will not be considered during this phase. Figure 2 represents the project architecture.

</h1>

To design this project we chose the MVC architecture, using DTO on the layers. The reason for this choice is that with mvc architecture we have the following benefits:
- System maintenance becomes easier;
- Reuse of code, mainly from the model layer, which can be reused in other projects;
- Easy for multiple developers to collaborate and work together;
- Easier to debug as we have multiple levels correctly written in the app;
